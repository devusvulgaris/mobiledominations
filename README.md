This is the project where I sell access to mobile app builder.

This is Wordpress website with blog and e-commerce features.

In this project I used LESS preprocessor for styling, I added animations and designed front page as landing page for better user experience. I used Bootstrap-ready starter theme called "_tk",which provides scaffolding and I created visual and graphic design. 

I wrote plugin to add additional post type "Tutorials" and new categories for this post type. Also I changed checkout form and made it less distructive for clients (removed extra billing and shipping fields).

I set up Woo Commerce and payment system, added subscription form, online chat and tested "Call to action" popups, so website converts and brings sales periodically.

I added plugin and theme files to this repository as well.
